/**
 TPTimelineUpload relies on NSNotificationCenter to communicate the status of asynchronous processes to
 dependencies. This pattern shares the same responsibilities as the protocol/delegate pattern. The key
 difference is this pattern relies on NSNotifications rather than messages to a delegate object.
 
 Usage: Include this .h in any dependency and use the extern'd NSString constants for notification names and/or objects.
