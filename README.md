# libTPTimelineUpload
## A static library for iOS which allows uploading images to a specific date on a Facebook user's Timeline, which is currently unsupported by the API.

### Discussion
There is currently no official, public Facebook Timeline API methods, which was the motivation to create this unofficial interface library.

This library relies on web scraping and customized HTTP requests, as opposed to an official API method.

This has been released as a static library to prevent Facebook from (easily) breaking the implementation. That said, **Facebook could break this library at any time.**

**Remember to include all dependencies listed below within your project.**
